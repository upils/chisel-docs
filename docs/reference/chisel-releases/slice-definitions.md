# Slice definitions

{ref}`Slices <slices_explanation>` are described in slice definitions files (aka SDFs).
These are YAML files, named after the package name.

(slice_definitions_location)=

## Location

The slice definitions files are located in the `slices/` directory of
{ref}`chisel-releases_ref`. And the slices for a given package `hello` are defined in
`slices/hello.yaml`.

```{tip}
Although the `hello.yaml` file can be placed in a sub-directory of `slices/` e.g.
`slices/dir/hello.yaml`, it is generally recommended to keep them at
`slices/hello.yaml`. The {{chisel_releases_repo}} follows the latter.
```

```{note}
In format `v3`, bin slice definitions (i.e. slice definitions for packages
fetched from a {ref}`store<slice_definitions_format_store>`) must be stored in
a separate, top-level, `bin-slices/` directory rather than in `slices/`. This
is a backwards compatibility mechanism for Chisel versions that do not support
stores: those old versions only read `slices/` and are unaware of
`bin-slices/`, so they are not affected by the new store fields. From format
`v4` onwards, bin slice definitions live in `slices/` alongside regular ones,
so `bin-slices/` is not read.
```

(slice_definitions_format)=

## Format specification

(slice_definitions_format_package)=

### `package`

| Field     | Type     | Required |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| `package` | `string` | Required |

Indicates the package name. It must follow the
[Debian policy for package name](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-binary.html#the-package-name).

The use of arbitrary package names is not allowed; the names must be the 
same as the package names in the archive to maintain a single namespace 
to remember and respect.

Chisel does not support pinning package versions. Chisel always fetches 
the latest version of a package from the archives. Thus, the root file 
systems Chisel produces in subsequent executions may not be identical if 
a package has changed in the meantime.

As indicated above, the value must also match the YAML file basename.
For example:

```yaml
package: hello
```
(slice_definitions_format_archive)=

### `archive`

| Field     | Type     | Required | Supported values                                                      |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `archive` | `string` | Optional | Archive name, from {ref}`archives<chisel_yaml_format_spec_archives>`. |

Specifies a particular
{ref}`archive<chisel_yaml_format_spec_archives>` from where this package should be
fetched from. If specified, Chisel fetches this package from that archive despite the
{ref}`chisel_yaml_format_spec_archives_default` and
{ref}`chisel_yaml_format_spec_archives_priority` settings in
{ref}`chisel_yaml_ref`.


The archive name must be defined in {ref}`chisel_yaml_format_spec_archives`.
For example:

```yaml
archive: ubuntu
```

```{note}
The `archive` field and the {ref}`store<slice_definitions_format_store>`
field are mutually exclusive: a package must be fetched from either an
archive or a store, but not both.
```

(slice_definitions_format_store)=

### `store`

| Field   | Type     | Required | Supported values                                                  | Compatibility |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `store` | `string` | Optional | Store name, from {ref}`stores<chisel_yaml_format_spec_stores>`.   | >= `v3`       |

Specifies a particular {ref}`store<chisel_yaml_format_spec_stores>` from
where this package should be fetched. If specified, Chisel fetches this
package from that store rather than from an archive. The store name must be
defined in {ref}`chisel_yaml_format_spec_stores`.

The `store` field is mutually exclusive with
{ref}`archive<slice_definitions_format_archive>`: a package must be fetched
from either an archive or a store, but not both.

When `store` is set, {ref}`default-track<slice_definitions_format_default_track>`
must also be set.

For example:

```yaml
store: bin
default-track: 3.1
```


(slice_definitions_format_default_track)=

### `default-track`

| Field           | Type     | Required                                  | Supported values | Compatibility |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| `default-track` | `string` | Required when `store` is set.             | A track name.    | >= `v3`       |

Specifies the default track for a {ref}`store<slice_definitions_format_store>`
package.

This field is required when {ref}`store<slice_definitions_format_store>` is
set, and must not be set when `store` is not set.

For example:

```yaml
store: bin
default-track: 3.1
```

(slice_definitions_format_essential)=

### `essential`

This field is similar to {ref}`slice_definitions_format_slices_essential`,
but applicable for every slice within the package.

```{note}
`essential` has different types across different
{ref}`formats<chisel_yaml_format_spec_format>`.
```

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Format **v3**
| Field       | Type     | Required |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| `essential` | `object` | Optional |

A map of slices, in their full name (e.g. `hello_copyright`),
alongside their `essential`-specific properties.

#### `essential.<slice>.arch`

| Field  | Type                        | Required | Supported values                                                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arch` | `string` or `array<string>` | Optional | `amd64`, `arm64`, `armhf`, `i386`, `ppc64el`, `riscv64`, `s390x` |

Used to specify the package architectures an _essential_ dependency should be
installed for. This field can take a single architecture string or a list, as its
value.

In the following example, `hello_copyright` will be installed for every installation
of every slice of the `hello` package, while `foo_bar` will only be installed
for `arm64` installations of any slice within `hello`.

```yaml
package: hello
essential:
  hello_copyright: {}
  foo_bar: {arch: arm64}
slices:
  ...
```

````

````{tab-item} Formats **v1** and **v2**
| Field       | Type            | Required | Supported values   |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| `essential` | `array<string>` | Optional | An existing slice. |

Slices in this list must be written in their full name, e.g.
`hello_copyright`.

In the following example, the `hello_copyright` slice is an _essential_ for
every slice including the `hello_bins` slice.

```yaml
package: hello
essential:
  - hello_copyright
slices:
  bins:
    contents:
      ...
  copyright:
    ...
```
````
`````


(slice_definitions_format_slices)=

### `slices`

| Field    | Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `slices` | `object` | Required |

Defines the slices of a package.

The slice names must consist only of lower case letters(`a-z`), digits(`0-9`)
and minus (`-`) signs. They must be at least three characters long and must start
with a letter(`a-z`).

For example, a slice definition called `data`, for the `ca-certificates` package,
could look like the following:

```yaml
slices:
  data:
    essential:
      - openssl_data
    contents:
      /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt: {text: FIXME, mutable: true}
      /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/: {until: mutate}
      /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/**: {until: mutate}
    mutate: |
      certs_dir = "/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/"
      certs = [
        content.read(certs_dir + path) for path in content.list(certs_dir)
      ]
      content.write("/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", "".join(certs))
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_essential)=

### `slices.<name>.essential`

This field is similar to {ref}`slice_definitions_format_essential`,but only applicable for the current
slice.

```{note}
`slices.<name>.essential` has different types across different
{ref}`formats<chisel_yaml_format_spec_format>`.
```

`````{tab-set}

````{tab-item} Format **v3**
| Field       | Type     | Required |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| `essential` | `object` | Optional |

A map of slices, and their `essential`-specific properties, that are needed and that must be installed before
the current slice.
These slice names must be written in their full name e.g. `hello_copyright`. 


#### `slices.<name>.essential.<slice>.arch`

| Field  | Type                        | Required | Supported values                                                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arch` | `string` or `array<string>` | Optional | `amd64`, `arm64`, `armhf`, `i386`, `ppc64el`, `riscv64`, `s390x` |

Used to specify the package architectures an _essential_ dependency should be
installed for. This field can take a single architecture string or a list, as its
value.

In the following example:
 - `gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu_gcc` is a requirement for the `gcc` slice, only on `arm64` installations,
 - `gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu_gcc` is a requirement for the `gcc` slice, only on `amd64` installations, and
 - `gcc-15_gcc-15` is a requirement for the `gcc` slice, for all installations.

```yaml
slices:
  gcc:
    essential:
      gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu_gcc: {arch: [arm64]}
      gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu_gcc: {arch: [amd64]}
      gcc-15_gcc-15:

```
````

````{tab-item} Formats **v1** and **v2**
| Field       | Type            | Required | Supported values   |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| `essential` | `array<string>` | Optional | An existing slice. |

Lists the slices that are needed and that must be installed before the current slice.
Slices in this list must be written in their full name
e.g. `hello_copyright`. 

In the following example, `libc6_libs` is a requirement for the `bins`
slice and must be installed when installing the `bins` slice.

```yaml
slices:
  bins:
    essential:
      - libc6_libs
```
````


`````


(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents)=

### `slices.<name>.contents`

| Field      | Type     | Required |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| `contents` | `object` | Optional |

Describes the paths that come from this slice.

```{note}
Paths must be absolute and must start with `/`.


Also, paths can have wildcard characters (`?`, `*` and `**`), where
 * `?` matches any one character, except for `/`,
 * `*` matches zero or more characters, except for `/`, and
 * `**` matches zero or more characters, including `/`.
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_copy)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.copy`

| Field  | Type     | Required |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| `copy` | `string` | Optional |

The `copy` field refers to the path Chisel should copy the target path from.

In the following example, Chisel copies the `/bin/original` file from the
package onto `/bin/moved`.

```yaml
    contents:
      /bin/moved: {copy: /bin/original}
```

```{note}
This field is only applicable to paths with no wildcards, and its value
must also be an absolute path with no wildcards.
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_make)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.make`

| Field  | Type      | Required | Supported values |
| ------ | --------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| `make` | `boolean` | Optional | `true`, `false`  |

If `make` is true, Chisel creates the specified directory path. Note that, the
path must be an absolute directory path with a trailing `/`. If
{ref}`mode<slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_mode>` is not specified, Chisel
creates the directory with `0755`.

```yaml
    contents:
      /path/to/dir/: {make: true}
```

```{note}
This field is only applicable for paths with no wildcards.
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_text)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.text`

| Field  | Type     | Required |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| `text` | `string` | Optional |

The `text` field instructs Chisel to create a text file with the specified
value as the file content. If empty, Chisel creates an empty file of 0 bytes.

In the following example, `/file` is created with the content `Hello world!`.
If {ref}`mode<slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_mode>` is not specified,
Chisel creates the file with `0644`.

```yaml
    contents:
      /file: {text: "Hello world!"}
```

```{note}
This field is only applicable for paths with no wildcards.
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_symlink)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.symlink`

| Field     | Type     | Required |
| --------- | -------- | -------- |
| `symlink` | `string` | Optional |

The `symlink` field is used to create symbolic links. If specified, Chisel
creates a symlink to the target path specified by the `symlink` value. The value
must be an absolute path with no wildcards.

In the following example, Chisel creates the symlink `/link` which points to
`/file`.

```yaml
    contents:
      /link: {symlink: /file}
```

```{note}
This field is only applicable for paths with no wildcards.
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_mode)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.mode`

| Field  | Type      | Required |
| ------ | --------- | -------- |
| `mode` | `integer` | Optional |

The `mode` field is used to specify the permission bits for any path Chisel
creates. It takes in a 32 bit unsigned integer, preferably in an octal value
format e.g. `0755` or `0o755`. For example:

```yaml
    contents:
      /file: {text: "Hello world!", mode: 0755}
```

```{note}
It can only be used with
{ref}`copy<slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_copy>`,
{ref}`make<slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_make>` and
{ref}`text<slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_text>`.

This field is only applicable for paths with no wildcards.
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_arch)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.arch`

| Field  | Type                        | Required | Supported values                                                 |
| ------ | --------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `arch` | `string` or `array<string>` | Optional | `amd64`, `arm64`, `armhf`, `i386`, `ppc64el`, `riscv64`, `s390x` |

Used to specify the package architectures a path should be
installed for. This field can take a single architecture string or a list, as its
value.

In the following example, `/foo` will be installed for `i386` installations and
`/bar` will be installed for `amd64` or `arm64` installations.

```yaml
    contents:
      /foo: {arch: i386}
      /bar: {arch: [amd64, arm64]}
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_mutable)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.mutable`

| Field     | Type      | Required | Supported values |
| --------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| `mutable` | `boolean` | Optional | `true`, `false`  |

If `mutable` f set to `true`, indicates that this path can be later
_mutated_ (modified) by the {{mutation_scripts}}.

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_until)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.until`

| Field   | Type     | Required | Supported values |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| `until` | `string` | Optional | `mutate`         |

The `until` field indicates that the path will be available until a certain
event takes place. The file is eventually removed as soon as no other slices need
it.

It currently accepts only one value - `mutate`. If specified, it means the
corresponding slice needs it to be available only until the {{mutation_scripts}}
execute. It is removed afterwards, if no slices need it.

In the following example, `/file` will not be installed in the final root file
system but will exist throughout the execution of the {{mutation_scripts}}.

```yaml
    contents:
      /file: {until: mutate}
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_generate)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.generate`

| Field      | Type     | Required | Supported values |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| `generate` | `string` | Optional | `manifest`       |

Used to specify the location where Chisel should produce metadata at. The path
this field applies to must not have any other fields applied to it.

The specified path must be a directory and must end with double-asterisks (`**`).
Additionally, the path must not contain any other wildcard characters except the trailing double-asterisks (`**`).

Currently, `generate` only accepts one value - `manifest`. If specified, Chisel
creates the {ref}`chisel_manifest_ref` file in that directory.

In the following example, Chisel creates the `/var/lib/chisel` directory with
`0755` mode and produces a {ref}`"manifest.wall"<chisel_manifest_ref>` file within the directory.

```yaml
    contents:
      /var/lib/chisel/**: {generate: manifest}
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_contents_prefer)=

### `slices.<name>.contents.<path>.prefer`

| Field      | Type     | Required | Introduced in format |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `prefer`   | `string` | Optional | {ref}`v2<chisel_yaml_format_spec_format>` |

Used to resolve a path conflict across multiple packages.

The same path may be declared in multiple packages without a conflict if, and
only if Chisel can guarantee that the paths’ content will be the same, without
downloading the packages. For all other cases, Chisel raises a conflict error,
unless the conflict is resolved via the `prefer` field.

The value of the `prefer` field must match the name of an existing package in
the release, and it can be used to specify which package should take
precedence, in a linear sequence, such that when there are multiple occurrences
of the same path across multiple packages, Chisel will install the one from
the package that appears last in the linear chain.

For example:

```yaml
package: hyena
slices:
  bins:
    content:
      /usr/bin/eat: { text: FOO, prefer: lion }
---
package: lion
slices:
  bins:
    content:
      /usr/bin/eat:  { text: FOO, prefer: hippo }
---
package: hippo
slices:
  bins:
    content:
      /usr/bin/eat:
```

With the above, the following behavior is observed:

- `chisel cut … <pkg>_bins` would get the path from `<pkg>` (regardless of it being `hyena`, `lion` or `hippo`),
- `chisel cut … hyena_bins lion_bins` would get the path from `lion`, and
- `chisel cut … hyena_bins lion_bins hippo_bins` would get the path from `hippo`.

```{note}
Since `prefer` can only be used for inter-package conflicts, its value must be
the same for all occurrences of the path within the same package.
```

```{note}
The `prefer` field cannot be used with globs.
```

(slice_definitions_format_slices_mutate)=

### `slices.<name>.mutate`

| Field    | Type     | Required | Supported values    |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| `mutate` | `string` | Optional | {{Starlark}} script |

Describes a slice's mutation scripts. The mutation scripts are conceptually similar
to [Debian's maintainer
script](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-maintainerscripts.html).

The mutation scripts are written in Google's {{Starlark}} language and are executed
after the files of every slice have been installed in the root file system. The
mutation scripts are run once per each installed slice, in the same order of
slices.

In addition to {{Starlark}}'s native syntax, Chisel introduces the following
functions:

| Function              | Return type     | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `content.list(d)`     | `array<string>` | Lists and returns directory `d`'s contents (similar to GNU `ls`) |
| `content.read(f)`     | `string`        | Reads a text file `f` and returns its contents                   |
| `content.write(f, s)` | -               | Writes the text content `s` to a file `f`                        |

Reusing the above {ref}`"ca-certificates_data"<slice_definitions_format_slices>`
example, Chisel initially creates the `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` text
file with `FIXME` as its content. When the mutation scripts execute, Chisel
concatenates the contents of every file in the `/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/`
directory and writes the concatenated data to the previously created
`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` file.

```yaml
    contents:
      /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt: {text: FIXME, mutable: true}
      /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/: {until: mutate}
      /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/**: {until: mutate}
    mutate: |
      certs_dir = "/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/"
      certs = [
        content.read(certs_dir + path) for path in content.list(certs_dir)
      ]
      content.write("/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt", "".join(certs))
```

Due to the usage of `until`, the `/usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/` directory
and the files inside are not present in the final root file system.

(slice_definitions_format_slices_hint)=

### `slices.<name>.hint`

| Field  | Type     | Required | Introduced in format |
| ------ | -------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `hint` | `string` | Optional | {ref}`v3<chisel_yaml_format_spec_format>` |

Provides a concise and unopinionated discriminator to help the user select slices.
It focuses on describing the *subset* of contents coming from this slice. It does
not describe the package.

It must be in a nominal passive style, written as a noun phrase:
- No initial articles: Do not start with `A`, `An`, and `The`.
- No finite verbs: Do not use `is`, `are`, `has,` or `contains`, or active
  verbs like `generates`.

Formatting:
- A maximum of 40 characters long.
- Only of alphanumeric characters, periods (`.`), commas (`,`), semicolons
  (`;`), parentheses (`(`, `)`).
- Sentence case: Start with an uppercase letter (e.g. `All timezones` not
  `all timezones`).
- Semicolons to separate multiple unrelated fragments of information.
  (e.g. `No jaotc; binutils required`).
- No trailing punctuation: Do not end with a period or other punctuation
 marks.
- No line breaks: Must be a single line.
- Uppercase for acronyms (e.g. `HTTP` not `Http`).

Example:

```yaml
slices:
  tzdata-legacy_etc:
    hint: Non-standard timezones
```

(slice_definitions_example)=

## Example

The slice definitions files can be found in the {{chisel_releases_repo}}, or
inspected via the {{info_cmd}}. Here is a short example of the `hello` package
slice definitions:

```yaml
package: hello

essential:
  - hello_copyright

slices:
  bins:
    essential:
      - libc6_libs
    contents:
      /usr/bin/hello:

  copyright:
    contents:
      /usr/share/doc/hello/copyright:
```
