# Chisel

**Chisel** is a developer tool for extracting highly customized and specialized [package slices](slices_explanation) of Ubuntu packages to create 
compact, secure software.

Users need to be able to create software suited to their specific needs with a reduced attack 
surface and a small storage footprint. With Chisel, users build a minimal root filesystem by 
selecting and installing only the necessary slices from the full Ubuntu package set.
