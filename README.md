# Chisel documentation

Sources for building the [Chisel documentation].


## Chisel repositories

- [chisel] - main repository of the project
- [chisel-docs] - documentation repository
- [chisel-releases] - collection of package slice definitions


## Contribution guides

Prior to contributing, you must -

- read and get acquainted with the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct] and
- sign the [Canonical contributor license agreement].


### Style guides

The documentation follows the [Diataxis] principles.

The commits follow the [Conventional Commits v1.0.0] guidelines.


### Configure your environment

Chisel documentation is built on top of [Sphinx starter pack] and hosted on
[Read the Docs].

To work on the project, you will need to have Python, `python3.12-venv`, and `make` packages.

```bash
sudo apt install make python3 python3.12-venv
```


### Workshop

[Workshop](https://github.com/canonical/workshop) can also be used for local
development. With the `workshop` snap installed, one can create a development environment using:

```
workshop launch
# Then serve the local render of the docs
workshop run chisel-docs-dev run
```

See the [workshop documentation](https://ubuntu.com/workshop/docs/) for more information.


### Build documentation locally

The Makefile in the [docs/](docs/) directory contains many targets. To see all
possible `make` commands, run `make help`.

To watch, build and serve the document, run `make run`. To learn more, check
out the [Sphinx starter pack website].


### Submit a pull request

After submitting a pull request, a few Github workflows run automatically to
test the changes. If one of those fails, click on the failing workflow to see
the logs to troubleshoot.

Note: more tests will be added in the future.
<!-- TODO: update the tests description once there are more -->

After submitting a pull request, your changes will be reviewed by a project
maintainer.


### Custom page meta descriptions

The meta description provides a summary of the page. Search engines often reuse this for the search result’s snippet.

All **new** pages must include a meta description. To set custom HTML meta descriptions in MyST-MD, use front matter at the top of the document as shown below:

```
---
myst:
  html_meta:
    description: Your description of the page.
---
```

Please observe the following guidelines:

- Use a maximum of 160 characters.
- Summarize the content of the page, where possible.
- Keep the language simple, avoid unnecessary adverbs or adjectives.
- Use an informative tone, frame sentences in terms of actions and facts.
- Use the tool name and page-specific terminology that users are likely to use when searching for information. 
- Place key terms near the start.
- Don’t include key terms that aren’t on the page.
  

### Get help

If you are a new contributor to documentation in general and would like some
guidance, you can check out the [Open Documentation Academy repository] or ask
a question on [Open Documentation Academy discourse].
